# Vector-Iterator

A small **std::vector-like C++ class** created for **practice and learning purposes**.  
It helps understand **dynamic memory management**, **copy/move semantics**, and **basic iterators**.

### Features
- Dynamic resizing (`push_back`, `pop_back`, `reserve`, `shrink_to_fit`)
- Copy and move constructors and assignment operators
- Simple iterator and const iterator support
- Basic utility functions like `reverse` and `clear`

### Note
This is **not a replacement for `std::vector`** — it’s a simplified version made only for **educational use**.
